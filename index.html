            <p>I am so grateful to Almighty that I was gifted with you, someone so spacial. I couldnâ€™t thank you enough
                for what you did for me.
                You were always there for me. From the day I started to learn how to walk, till now. You were always
                there no matter what. I love you so much. And wishing you a very very happy birthday. May Allah always
                give you the best, may He always makes you happy.</p>
